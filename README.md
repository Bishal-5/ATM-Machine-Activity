# ATM-Machine-Activity
<p>This Python project simulates the functionality of an ATM machine, allowing users to perform basic banking activities such as money withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry. The program prompts users to enter their ATM card number, select the desired transaction, and enter their ATM PIN. It also includes a security feature that limits the user to three incorrect PIN attempts before exiting the program.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The program begins by prompting the user to enter their ATM card number.</li>
                <li>It verifies the card number's validity (you may use a predefined set of card numbers for simulation purposes).</li>
                <li>After successful card number validation, the user is prompted to choose a transaction: money withdrawal, deposit, or balance inquiry.</li>
            </ul>  
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Handling</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Money Withdrawal: </strong> Users can specify the amount they want to withdraw from their account.</li>
                <li><strong>Deposit: </strong> Users can deposit money into their account by entering the desired amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Balance: </strong> Users can inquire about their account balance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exiting the Application:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To exit the application, select the appropriate option from the menu.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Security Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The program includes a security mechanism that allows the user three attempts to enter the correct ATM PIN.</li>
                <li>If the user fails to provide the correct PIN within three attempts, the program exits for security reasons.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
